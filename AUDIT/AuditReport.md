## Executive Summary

**Status**: Integration skeletons are in place for MCP (Google, Supabase, Figma, Rive) and a Next.js app with tRPC, Drizzle, and NextAuth. Type-checking currently fails in `app/` due to missing installed deps (tsc cannot resolve packages). Database migration requires a `DATABASE_URL`. UI can render once dependencies are installed and env configured.

### Key Findings (Severity)
- **P0**
  - App typecheck fails: unresolved modules (tRPC, NextAuth, framer-motion, Rive, axios, postgres). Requires `pnpm -C app install` to wire deps, or aligning workspace dep resolution.
  - DB migration blocked: `DATABASE_URL` missing; `pnpm -C app db:migrate` fails until `.env.local` is set.
- **P1**
  - tRPC handler runtime fixed to Node.js (compatible with Postgres). Keep as Node unless edge-safe DB client is used.
  - MCP Supabase `db_create_table` executes raw SQL via `exec_sql` RPC placeholder. Needs safer migration path.
- **P2**
  - No linting for `app/`. Monorepo uses Biome at root; propose enabling Biome in `app/`.
  - No CI for app build/typecheck; propose minimal GH Actions.
- **P3**
  - Tailwind config note appends by Figma MCP (placeholder) â€” fine for dev, gate behind explicit flag in prod.

## Repo Overview

- Node: v24.5.0, pnpm: 10.14.0, macOS 26.0
- Workspaces detected via pnpm list. Monorepo has `apps/` and `packages/`; new `app/` is standalone and not in workspace. Consider adding `app` to `pnpm-workspace.yaml` if desired.
- Scripts
  - Root includes turbo workflows and Biome.
  - `mcp-servers/` scripts: start:google | start:supabase | start:figma | start:rive.
  - `app/` scripts: dev | build | start | db:gen | db:migrate | db:studio.
- Notable gaps
  - App lacks ESLint/Biome integration; rely on root Biome or per-app config.
  - No tests in `app/`.
  - Mixed module systems across repo are acceptable; `app/` uses ESM and Next 14.
- Red flags
  - Type deps missing in `app/` (P0).
  - `mcp-servers` includes both JS and TS implementations; keep one path authoritative.
