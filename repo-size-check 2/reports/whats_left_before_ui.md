  - Recent operations log

- **Backup Management Interface**
  - Current backup status
  - Archive management
  - Manual backup triggers
  - Retention policy settings

### Phase 2: File Operations (M - 2-3 weeks)
- **File Ingest Interface**
  - Upload files to ingest folder
  - File processing status
  - Routing results display
  - Error handling and retry

- **File Browser**
  - Navigate stored files
  - Search and filter
  - File metadata display
  - Download/restore operations

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (L - 3-4 weeks)
- **Configuration Management UI**
  - Environment variable editor
  - Provider setup wizards
  - Validation and testing tools

- **Monitoring and Analytics**
  - Operation metrics dashboard
  - Performance monitoring
  - Usage analytics
  - Alert management

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Notes

### Frontend Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (already configured)
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (already configured)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (already configured)
- **State Management**: React hooks + context
- **API Client**: Fetch or axios for backend communication

### Backend Integration Points
```typescript
// Example API endpoints to implement
interface SystemAPI {
  GET /api/health - System health status
  GET /api/config - Current configuration
  POST /api/config - Update configuration
  GET /api/backups - Backup status and history
  POST /api/backups/rotate - Trigger backup rotation
  GET /api/files - File listing and metadata
  POST /api/files/upload - Upload to ingest folder
  GET /api/operations - Recent operations log
}
```

### Data Flow Architecture
1. **UI Components** â†’ **API Layer** â†’ **Backend Services**
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket or polling for status changes
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback
4. **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders and progress indicators

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Considerations

### Design System
- **Consistent with existing branding** (BigSkyAg)
- **Responsive design** for desktop and mobile
- **Accessibility compliance** (WCAG 2.1)
- **Dark/light mode support**

### User Experience
- **Intuitive navigation** with clear information hierarchy
- **Progressive disclosure** for complex operations
- **Confirmation dialogs** for destructive actions
- **Helpful error messages** with remediation steps

### Performance
- **Fast initial load** with code splitting
- **Efficient data fetching** with caching
- **Optimistic updates** for better perceived performance
- **Background processing** for long-running operations

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based authentication** (already implemented)
- **Role-based access control** for different user types
- **Session management** with secure token handling
- **API rate limiting** to prevent abuse

### Data Protection
- **Input validation** on both client and server
- **XSS protection** with proper content sanitization
- **CSRF protection** for state-changing operations
- **Secure file uploads** with validation and scanning

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Page load time** < 2 seconds
- **API response time** < 500ms
- **Test coverage** > 80%
- **Zero critical security vulnerabilities**

### User Experience Metrics
- **Task completion rate** > 95%
- **Error rate** < 2%
- **User satisfaction** > 4.5/5
- **Time to complete common tasks** < 30 seconds

## ðŸš¨ Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API integration complexity**: Mitigate with comprehensive testing
- **Performance issues**: Mitigate with monitoring and optimization
- **Browser compatibility**: Mitigate with polyfills and testing

### Business Risks
- **User adoption**: Mitigate with user testing and feedback
- **Feature scope creep**: Mitigate with clear requirements and prioritization
- **Timeline delays**: Mitigate with agile development and regular check-ins
